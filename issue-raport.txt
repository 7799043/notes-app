## main problem: despite having access to the note's ID, I cannot use this ID to manage this note. I can neither share this note nor delete it. I can instead manage the entire note div. 
update: the problem lies in template literals

it's done 

01 database accepts invalid email despite client-side security features :

<input type="email" class="form-control" id="email" aria-describedby="emailHelp" pattern="^[^\s]+$" required>

02 the application crashes when an attempt is made to register a user with the same name 

03 the line (index.html line:84 : if (user && user.email){...}else...) doesn't work. It's not show alert ("Please login first.") when user && user.email is invaild. -> resolved 

04 id's button in 'let note = ` (...) ` doesn't work. It work only for class of div.
