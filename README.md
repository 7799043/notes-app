## Notes App 

<p>As a test automation developer, I am constantly learning, so I need an app to keep my knowledge in one place. A web application would be a good choice because, firstly, it helps me improve my JS skills, and secondly, I can access my notes from anywhere. The process of learning requires updating notes and even deleting some notes as my knowledge evolves, so the app must adapt to these changes. Since the topics I cover are different, it's necessary to keep them organized in different accounts. This helps with organization. Sometimes, I need to change the background color, especially when I have ideas late in the evening.</p>

## Usage

1. Open the console or terminal on your local machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using console:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/7799043/notes-app.git
```
3. Go to the repository directory:
```sh
cd notes-app
```
4. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can check it by the following command:
 ```sh 
 node -v 
 ``` 
 or you can download the Node.js installer from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.

5. Install the project dependencies using the following command:
 ```sh
npm install
```
6. Now you can run application:
```sh
npm start
```
This command will start a development server hosting the Notes application. By default, the application will be available at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

7. Connect to an existing MongoDB cluster or create a new one.
<p>The Notes application might require a connection to a MongoDB database to store and retrieve data. Ensure you have an existing MongoDB cluster that you can connect to, or follow the MongoDB documentation (https://docs.mongodb.com) to create a new cluster based on your needs. Once you have the connection details (such as the connection URL), you may need to update the application's configuration to establish the connection with MongoDB.</p>
